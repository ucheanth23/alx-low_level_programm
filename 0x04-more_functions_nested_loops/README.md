3 - write a function that print the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4 - write a function that print the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
5 - write a function that print 10 times the number from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
6 - write a function that drews a straight line in the terminal.
7 - write a function that drews a diagonal line on the terminal.
8 - write a function that print a square, followed by a new line.
9 - Fizz-Buzz - write a pro«gram that print the number from 1 to 100 followed by a new line. But for the multiples three print Fizz the number and for multiple of five Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
